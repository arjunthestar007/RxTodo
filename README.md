# RxTodo
Getting started with RxJava 2

# Main objective
RxTodo project is part of TeamTreehouse's course ["Introduction to Rxjava"](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-rxjava) that was enrolled into, But i was very shocked 
to know that treehouse is still using RxJava 1 and Rxandroid 1.

So i tried integrated RxJava 2 and Rxandroid 2 into same project.

This repository contains 2 brances 
  1. master [~~Rx~~Todo without rx](https://github.com/ZeeshanShabbir/RxTodo) 
  2. rxjava2-implemented [RxTodo with rx](https://github.com/ZeeshanShabbir/RxTodo/tree/rxjava2-implemented)
